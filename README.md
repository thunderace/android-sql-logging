Log to a sql database for debugging. View the logs in-app with the LogViewerActivity.

This library was created when I decided that having my phone attached to logcat for hours in hopes a
heisenbug would appear in a service was too inefficient.

Works with API level 11+

Usage
-----

Logging is done manually by wait of...
```java
    LogEntry entry = LogEntry.createLogEntry(Log.DEBUG, TAG, "Hit critical function");
    LogEntryProvider.insertLogEntry(context, entry);
```
or
```java
    LogEntryProvider.insertLogEntry(context, Log.DEBUG, TAG, "Hit critical function");
```

...or you can plant a tree with Timber using `SQLLoggingTree`:

```java
public class App extends Application {

    // The default tag is used when no tag is provided.
	private static final String DEFAULT_TAG = "TimberSqlSampleApp";

	@Override
	public void onCreate() {
	    LogEntryProvider.initialize(this);
		Timber.plant(new SqlLoggingTree(this, DEFAULT_TAG));
	}
}
```

Setup
-----

In your app's AndroidManifest, you will need to include two items:
```xml
<activity
    android:name="io.explod.android.sqllog.ui.activity.LogViewerActivity"
    android:exported="false"/>

<!-- Important: set your own authority name and provide that name in the metadata -->

<provider
    android:name="io.explod.android.sqllog.data.LogEntryProvider"
    android:authorities="your.authority.name"
    android:exported="false"/>

<meta-data android:name="io.explod.sqllog.log.authority" android:value="your.authority.name"/>
```

And finally, to view the logs, you start the activity:
```java
	private void goToLogViewer() {
		Intent intent = new Intent(this, LogViewerActivity.class);
		startActivity(intent);
	}
```
